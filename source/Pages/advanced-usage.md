## Metadata schema definitionA metadata schema is a logical plan showing the relationships between metadata fields, normally through establishing rules for the use and management of metadata.
The first question to ask before making a metadata schema is: Is it necessary to create a new metadata schema, or are there already existing metadata schemas which can be adapted for use? We advice to reuse existing schemas. You can find best practices for defining you metadata schema [here] (http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/5271/N800R1_Where_to_start_advice_on_creating_a_metadata_schema.pdf).

To define a metadata schema for your data go to your account page. Your current metadata schemas is listed under the Schema part. To create a metadata schema click on "Add Schema".

 To define the metadata schema you need to provide a name, description and add the metadata fields to the schema.
